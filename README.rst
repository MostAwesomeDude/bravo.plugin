bravo.plugin
============

bravo.plugin is a standalone version of the plugin loader from Bravo, the
world's most extensible Minecraft server. Bravo's plugin loader was so useful
that people put Bravo into their projects just to get access to it. And now,
through the wonders of modern technology, we have revived this classic
software as a standalone module!

Requirements
============

Only ``zope.interface`` is required in order to use bravo.plugin. To run the
tests, one will need to have Trial installed as well::
